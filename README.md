# Mister Lucky Doge's 3 Reel Slots For Very Good Boys
### (wow)

## User Stories
Doge has invited you to his 1996 Geocities/Angelfire personal website casino to play a night of slots! He give yuo 5 dogecoins, on the house. Much luck! So excite!

Each reel will have 12 symbols on it: the numbers 1 to 9, lucky Doge, our lord and savior Nicolas Cage, and **BORK!** (instead of BAR) 12 x 12 x 12 = 1728 possible combinations in total, though only a few are hard-coded to be wins. The winning combinations are:
```
3x Doges or 3x 7s (Lucky Sevens) = 5 dogecoins
3x Bork! or 3x Nicolas Cage = 3 dogecoins
3 wons = no win, but a free play
Any other matches: one dogecoin
```
Game is over when yuo have no more dogecoin to give doge. Doge reminds yuo to play very responsible. Much addict. Very danger.

## Changes from initial pitch to v1.0 completion
My intial stretch goals were too ambitious, especially in response and animation. Working by myself with untested dev tools, there was very little chance I could have included all the scripted actions I wanted to in the wireframes. I've scaled them down to one statement: 'tighter UX design.' Although the website is intentionally invoking the aesthetic of poorly designed hobbyist websites from the early 90s era (the Angelfire, Geocities, Netscape epoch), I have seen examples of well designed UI that invokes that aesthetic without sacrificing the conveniences of contemporary web design. The slot reel animation itself was a compromise, and then another compromise when that first compromise still proved too daunting. Later on I would like to revisit this project using pre-built "slot machine" plug-ins.
