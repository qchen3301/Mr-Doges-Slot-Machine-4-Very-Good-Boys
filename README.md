# Mister Lucky Doge's 3 Reel Slots For Very Good Boys
### wow

## User Stories
Doge has invited you to his 1996 Geocities/Angelfire personal website casino to play a night of slots! He give yuo 5 dogecoins, on the house. To play the slot machine, insert a coin into the coin slot, then pull the lever. Much luck! So excite!

Like a real slot machine, the animation for the slot reels will start off slow, speed up very quickly, and then slow down sequentially from left to right.
Each reel will have 12 symbols on it: the numbers 1 to 9, lucky Doge, a Nicolas Cage, and the bork! (instead of BAR)

	*as a interlingual pun, the number 1 will be written in Japanese katakana (ワン - 'won'), all other numbers will be represented in their Arabic/Hindic forms.*

12 x 12 x 12 = 1728 possible combinations in total, though only a few are hard-coded to be wins. The user will be able to pull up a modul menu to see what the winning combinations are.
	Winning combinations:
		- Three lucky doges = 5 dogecoins 
		- Three sevens or three ones = 3 dogecoins
		- Three borks! or three Cages = 2 dogecoins

		- Stretch goal: Any two sequential matches will give a free play. For example: drawing a 3, 3, and a doge, or a bork!, 5 and 5 but NOT a 5, bork! and closing with a 5. The free play conditional will be mentioned in the modul menu (assuming I can implement the function correctly)

Game is over when yuo have no more dogecoin to give doge. Mister Lucky Doge reminds yuo to play very responsible. Much addict. Very danger.
